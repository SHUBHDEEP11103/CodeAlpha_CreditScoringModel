Credit Scoring Model – CodeAlpha Task 1

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Credit Scoring Model using Python and Machine Learning. It generates synthetic financial data, trains a Random Forest Classifier, evaluates its performance, and demonstrates predictions for sample customers.

The main objective is to classify customers into Good Credit or Bad Credit categories based on their financial and credit history.
